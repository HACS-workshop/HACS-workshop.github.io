<p>
Recent years have seen major advances in the application of formal methods and other high assurance verification techniques to software.  
At the same time, there’s been a rapid increase in the use of cryptography to protect civil society and critical information systems.
</p>

<p>
We see these trends continuing to converge. 
The importance and complexity of cryptographic software makes it an ideal application 
for formal and high-assurance verification.  
The Workshop on High Assurance Crypto Software (HACS) was launched in 2016
by 
<a href="https://gbarthe.github.io/">Gilles Barthe</a>, 
Ben Laurie, and 
Trevor Perrin 
to drive this convergence forward.  
As a yearly event, we’ve been bringing the world’s best cryptographic developers 
(from open source and industry) together with top experts in formal verification and high assurance methodologies.  
The goal is to foster collaborations towards making cryptographic software flawless.
