<h3>HACS 2022</h3>

<p>
HACS 2022 was held in April 2022.
At HACS 2022, we consolidated the focus of the workshop to expand into formal
verification of security proofs, secure distributed computation, topics
relevant to cryptocurrencies and security issues at the hardware/software
boundary.

<h3>HACS 2021</h3>

<p>
HACS 2021 was held in April 2021 as virtual event.
HACS 2021 further broadened the focus of the workshop to expand into formal
verification of security proofs, secure distributed computation, topics
relevant to cryptocurrencies and security issues at the hardware/software
boundary.

<h3>HACS 2020</h3>

<p>
HACS 2020 was held in January 2020 in New York City.
In addition to discussions around testing, formal verification, and generation of crypto code,
HACS 2020 broadened the focus of the workshop towards cryptographic protocols,
zero-knowledge proofs, and advanced implementation attacks.
